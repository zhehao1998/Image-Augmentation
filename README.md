# Image Augmentation
Generate new training examples using albumentations library and google collab.

Note that the folder should roughly resemble the hierachy of the **Project** folder. 

Please make sure image and mask has the same file name in the folder, eg. "im01.png" for easier matching of image with its respective mask.

(Masks used for generation does not have to be binary)

# Dataset
Annotation and exporting of masks can be done using LabelMe, use the conversion.ipynb on **local** labelme folder to generate dataset
