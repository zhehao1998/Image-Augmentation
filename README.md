# Image Augmentation
Generate new training examples using albumentations library and google collab.

Folder used for augmentation should be similar to the organisation in the **Project** folder.

Otherwise, please make sure image and mask has the same file name, eg. "im01.png" for easier matching of image with its respective mask.

# Dataset
Annotation and exporting of masks can be done using LabelMe, use the conversion.ipynb on **local** labelme folder to generate dataset
