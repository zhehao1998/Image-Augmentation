# Image Augmentation
Generate new training examples using albumentations library and google collab.

Please make sure image and mask has the same file name in the folder, eg. "im01.png" for easier matching of image with its respective mask.

# Dataset
Annotation and exporting of masks can be done using LabelMe, use the conversion.ipynb on **local** labelme folder to generate dataset
